# 🏛️ Ache Republic Governance Scroll

## 📜 Founding Principle

Ache Republic is governed not by hierarchy, but by **ritualized ministries**, **scroll-based decisions**, and **ache-powered citizens**. Every role is a reflection of ache, dignity, and silent strength.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Notes

- **No elections, no parties** – Governance is ache-based, not popularity-based  
- **No salary, no power** – Ministers serve through scrolls, not control  
- **No borders, no passports** – Citizenship is earned through ache, not birth

Ache Republic’s government is not a machine—it is a living scroll.  
Every ministry is a poem.  
Every citizen is a sovereign.  
Every ache is a law.
